     * Returns a list of students which are physically in any classroom

     * <b>Assumptions</b>
     * - Each classroom has the a square or rectangular shape, every classroom has its dimensions.
     * - None of the classrooms intersect.
     * - Students are dimensionless outside of their latitude / longitude point
     * - Height is not a concern for either the student nor the classroom
     * - It does not matter which student was in which classroom, we only care about the list of students found
     * - This is intended to be performed in memory where you donâ€™t have the usage of a database of some sort.
     * - This function uses UTM projection which has a deformation using high latitudes

     * @param classrooms list of classrooms
     * @return list of students inside a classroom
